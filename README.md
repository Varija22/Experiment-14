Aim
To implement the concept of single inheritance in C++ using a base class `Vehicle` and a derived class `Car`.


Software Used
Programiz Online Compiler (for C++ execution and testing)

Theory

Inheritance is one of the fundamental features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

* It allows a class (derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (base class).
* The base class provides common functionality, while the derived class extends or customizes it.
* In single inheritance, one derived class inherits from only one base class.

In this program:

* The base class `Vehicle` defines a data member `brand` and a member function `colour()`.
* The derived class `Car` inherits from `Vehicle` and introduces its own data member `model`.
* Objects of the `Car` class can access both the base class members (`brand`, `colour()`) and its own member (`model`).

Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Define the base class `Vehicle` with:

   * A data member `brand`
   * A member function `colour()`
3. Define the derived class `Car` which inherits publicly from `Vehicle` and adds a data member `model`.
4. In the `main()` function:

   * Create an object of the derived class `Car`.
   * Access and display the base class data (`brand`).
   * Access and display the derived class data (`model`).
   * Call the inherited function `colour()`.
5. Stop the program.

Conclusion

The program successfully demonstrates single inheritance in C++.
The derived class `Car` inherited data members and functions from the base class `Vehicle` while also having its own members. This shows how **code reusability and extension of functionality are achieved through inheritance.


Program 2

Aim
To implement multiple inheritance in C++ using two base classes `Electronics` and `Specs`, and a derived class `Smartphone`.

Software Used
Programiz Online Compiler


Theory
Inheritance is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing a class to acquire properties and behaviors of other classes.

* Multiple inheritance occurs when a derived class inherits from more than one base class.
* It allows the derived class to combine functionalities from different classes, enhancing code reusability and organization.

In this program:

* `Electronics` is a base class containing `brand` and `model()`.
* `Specs` is a base class containing `battery` and `colour()`.
* `Smartphone` is a derived class that inherits publicly from both `Electronics` and `Specs`, and adds its own member `sim`.
* The object of `Smartphone` can access members from both base classes as well as its own members.


Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Define the first base class `Electronics` with:

   * Data member `brand`
   * Member function `model()`
3. Define the second base class `Specs` with:

   * Data member `battery`
   * Member function `colour()`
4. Define the derived class `Smartphone` that inherits publicly from `Electronics` and `Specs`.

   * Add a data member `sim`.
5. In the `main()` function:

   * Create an object of `Smartphone`.
   * Call the `colour()` function from `Specs`.
   * Access and print `brand` and call `model()` from `Electronics`.
   * Access and print `sim` and `battery` from `Smartphone` and `Specs`.
6. Stop the program.

Conclusion

The program successfully demonstrates multiple inheritance in C++.
The derived class `Smartphone` inherited members from both `Electronics` and `Specs`, while also containing its own members. This shows how a class can combine properties and methods from multiple sourcess, making the code more modular and reusable.

Program 3

Aim

To implement **multilevel inheritance** in C++ using three classes: `Animal`, `Mammal`, and `Dog`.

Software Used
Programiz Online Compiler

Theory
Inheritance is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another.

* Multilevel inheritance occurs when a class is derived from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
* In this program:

  * `Animal` is the base class containing `kingdom` and the `eat()` function.
  * `Mammal` is derived from `Animal` and adds `type` and `breathe()`.
  * `Dog` is derived from `Mammal` and adds `breed` and `sound()`.
* The `Dog` object can access members from all three classes, demonstrating how properties and methods propagate through multiple levels.

Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Define the base class `Animal` with a data member `kingdom` and a member function `eat()`.
3. Define the derived class `Mammal` that inherits from `Animal`. Add `type` and `breathe()`.
4. Define the derived class `Dog` that inherits from `Mammal`. Add `breed` and `sound()`.
5. In `main()` function:

   * Create an object of `Dog`.
   * Access and display `kingdom` and call `eat()` from `Animal`.
   * Access and display `type` and call `breathe()` from `Mammal`.
   * Access and display `breed` and call `sound()` from `Dog`.
6. Stop the program.

Conclusion

The program successfully demonstrates multilevel inheritance in C++.
The derived class `Dog` inherited properties and behaviors from `Mammal` and `Animal`, while also having its own members. This shows how **data and functions can be passed down multiple levels, improving code reusability and organization.
